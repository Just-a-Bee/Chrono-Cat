	Make settings work

Content:
	Tutorial

	Add more levels
	Nicer level select (mario world style?)

			Chrono cat wants to sleep in every bed in the world

Making the game pretty:
	Many more animations, including smoother collects and destroys, win animation, player animation, etc
	Two frame per step tail swoosh?

Bugs:
	Weird double opening of level? (rare)
