Make it so you cant move during tweens
Many more animations, including smoother collects and destroys, win animation, player animation, etc


Player animation idea:
	Cat jumps from tile to tile
		Jump up, down, left
	Cat also has cute idle animations
		Look around
		Sit
		Yawn
		Lay down
		Nap

Level script cleanups:
	Rework cursor to not use built-in position, and to have animation
	Clean up collision and floor functions
