UI:
	Settings menu

Content:
	Saving
	Add more levels
	Nicer level select (mario world style?)
	Story intro:
			Chrono cat wants to sleep in every bed in the world

Making the game pretty:
	Many more animations, including smoother collects and destroys, win animation, player animation, etc
	Player animation idea:
		Cat jumps from tile to tile
			Jump up, down, left
		Cat also has cute idle animations
			Look around
			Sit
			Yawn
			Lay down
			Nap

Cleanup:
	Level script cleanups:
		Rework cursor to not use built-in position, and to have animation
		Clean up collision and floor functions
		Collectables use their own script
		Make it so you cant move during tweens
